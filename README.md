# Rod-Monitor
Monitoring software for self-built laser system. The package includes a MATLAB GUI for the ROD amplifier. A 'sister' propgram for the REGEN amplifier can be found [here](https://github.com/cpkm/laser-monitor-regen). Both are based off of the same general code with tweaks for the specific app. The software monitors the diode pump power (optical) as well as temperatures in the system.

A 'new' app can be created for a specific system by copying the rod (or regen) code and modifying as needed.

## Overview of GUI
The GUI include sections for monitoring important stats of the laser system.
